Simple javascript-based browser game for 2700

    Overview:

Our game is called Burden. The premise of the game revolves around the idea
of “the more you have, the harder it gets.” Much like Pac-Man, the player will control
one character in a top-down isometric view, moving them around a tile set that takes up
the whole screen. The object of the game is to collect scattered “items” while avoiding
certain obstacles that can arise of the screen to increase their total score. We are using
javascript because of its extremely flexible nature of coding.


    Gameplay:

The player will most likely control a pixelated avatar roaming the boundaries of
the screen using the WASD keys. The players goal is to gather continuously spawning
“items” most of which will be small pixelated rectangles. As the player progressively
gathers more of these “items” the character’s movement responds to the weight of the
items acknowledging their Burden. With more items stored on the player, the slower the
player moves around the map making avoiding the killer obstacles much more difficult.
After a certain number of “items” are gathered a “special item”, denoted by its distinct
color and shape, will emerge on the map. If the player is able to pick up this “special
item” it will convert all of the items the player has to score and lift the burden on the
player, allowing them to move their normal speed.
